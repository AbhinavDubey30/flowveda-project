# FlowVeda Frontend (React + Bootstrap)

This is a minimal React frontend skeleton that talks to the Django backend API.

## Setup

1. From the frontend folder:
   ```
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

2. Make sure the Django backend is running (default http://127.0.0.1:8000).

Notes: This project uses Bootstrap for layout. The `services/api.js` file contains the API wrapper that your components use to talk to the backend.
